### About
The objective of the project was to design a queue simulator. It received as input data the number of queues available, the number of customers who will be served, and the maximum time it is open. In addition, for customers the maximum and minimum time at which they finished their shopping, and the interval of time they had to wait. The project had to generate, starting from these input data, a collection of customers with random data that respect the time intervals. Two strategies had to be implemented to make each customer's waiting time more efficient. The two strategies are the following:

• The customer should be added to the queue with the shortest waiting time

• The client should be added to the shortest queue in terms of length (with the fewest clients, regardless of waitingTime)
